Hi i am chiara from 1F and i finished my exams already YAYY
so i shall tell you about my post exam life :)
after the last exam which was maths, i went, together with three of my friends,Sasha Chloe and Cherilyn,to Sashas house.
we watched harry potter (the goblet of fire) and we planned to play badminton but played volleyball and frisbee instead. 
we also ate some snakes and ice cream and met this friendly old lady who was exercising.
that was a fun day hehe
I also went out with some of my other friends over the weekends
also, we have post exam activities in school.
yesterday we had a math trial which was a little boring but at least we got to interact with our classmates
today we did some hands on activities which included coloured rice decorating and making a mask holder out of a milk carton.
it was pretty fun
we also did a survey and computing
so far i am enjoying the time after  exams because there is no more stress and work that i have to complete so i can relax, and do the things that i enjoy
also, i watched 30 smth episodes of anime i two days hehe
